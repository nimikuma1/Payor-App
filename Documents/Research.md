Research conducted during the development of the Automated Prior Authorization Management System involved investigations into healthcare IT standards such as FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to understand its role in data exchange within the healthcare domain. Additionally, research focused on prior authorization challenges, including administrative burdens, as well as payer policies. Explorations into API integration in healthcare and user interface design principles for healthcare applications were undertaken to inform the design and implementation of the system. These research efforts provided vital insights that guided design and architecture choices, code measures, and user-centric approaches in developing a streamlined and effective prior authorization solution.
